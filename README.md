# challenge_5

This project runs monte carlo simulation on a two stock portfolio and pulls historical data on bitcoin and ethereum using API calls.

**Technologies**
The project is written in python 3.9 and uses the pandas, json, dotenv, matplotlib and MCforecasttools libraries as well as the alpaca api.


**Installation Guide**
Users may run the program in an IDE of their choice.

**Usage**
Users pull data using API calls and the json library and input into dataframes. Monte carlo simulations and simple calculation help users estimate future portfolio values. Data is plotted in time series charts and histograms for visual interpretation.

**Contributors**
The project was completed by jbena4 under the direction of instructors with the Columbia Engineering certificate program.

**License**
This project is free to distribute and licensed under MIT.
